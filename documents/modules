broadly; modules can be implemented by noting the
export and import lists of libraries/executables
within the object files being created/linked
together. As long as the library exports all
types and functions which it exposes outside of
itself; any code which needs to be linked
against said library could read that manifest and
know how to interface with that library. Thus,
object files can be linked together either statically
or dynamically.

this doesn't solve the problem of how we can know the
layout of said exported types, the obvious solution is
to somehow include that in the modules export list.
in a way that can be known by the compiler during creation
of a library/executable which is linking against that object
file.
