# Fix all the bugs

# Test[Parser(check), Typecheck, Codegen]

# Rewrite the Parser to a new grammar (maybe entirely, maybe just a little)
  # rewrite operators such that they are treated as tokens in their own right.
    (no more user defined operators, it makes the language hard to parse)
  # parenthesis-less call syntax. (more functional style)
  # optional type annotations in bind expressions
  # const-ness and mutability specifiers (I think these have to define new types?
    still considering the implementation of this tbch)
  # optional else clauses on conditionals
  # optional blocks in conditionals, loops, and functions.
    (can have a single affix expression instead)
