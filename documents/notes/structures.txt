structures are fairly simple, in that in their most basic form 
they are essentially tuples with named member access instead of 
numbered member access.
layout is the same, and lifetime is the same.

constructors are simply free functions with a this pointer as their 
first arguments. same with copy/move constructors and the destructor 
is simply stack deallocation. (because we have no heap yet)

so lets solve the problem of when to allocate things.
