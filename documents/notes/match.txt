regardless of the keyword, how could a match expression be implemented?

it should be easy to match over the active field in a union type!
that is tagged unions by default. (force all fields to have a unique 
name like a struct, and you can tell where to dispatch based upon 
which branch has which name.)

it should be easy to query over the data within the fields of record 
types. (c++ structured binding.)

exaustive listing of all possible values is a nice safety feature

well, this depends upon how record types are implemented, because isn't 
match a dispatch using the type being dispatched over as a guide for 
the structure of the branches?
