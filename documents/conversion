given that cpp already has many of the features that I want this language to have,
It would be much faster to prototype this language as a PinkToCPP compiler, 
rather than a hand rolled compiler. (setting aside the time to convert from what 
we have implemented now) It also helps that then we get things like a heap, debugger,
full linux interop, and address sanitizer for free. (to name just a few things)

It also helps that I already know cpp decently enough to imagine each peice of mapping.

the crux of our language rests on our ability to emit and manipulate cpp lambdas.
along with the usual suspects of programming language design, (parameters, tuples,
templates, etc).
