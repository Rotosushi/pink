Pink is a proof of concept programming language frontend, using llvm as it's backend.

Because I had to answer the question, what is the difficulty in implementing functions as values 
in a c like programming language? Because from my perspective other than the major difference 
listed above, C, and a simply typed, strictly evaluating, Lambda Calculus
 are very similar languages.
 
 
 I hope to get this project to a working stable version soon.
 Though, that doesn't mean 'fully featured programming language,'
 at least, not for the first stable version.
