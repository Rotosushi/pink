Pink is a proof of concept programming language frontend, using llvm as it's backend.

Because I had to answer the question, what is the difficulty in implementing functions as values
in a C-like programming language? Because from my perspective, other than the major difference
listed above, C and a simply typed strictly evaluating Lambda Calculus are very similar languages.

A cmake file builds the program,

mkdir build &&
cd build  &&
cmake .. &&
cmake --build . 

will build the program and the tests currently.
