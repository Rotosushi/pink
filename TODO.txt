# v0.0.1 
  -> Emit a working executable
  -> fix any memory leaks present now before adding anything new to the
     language
    (and the new cycle for adding to or updating the 
      language goes as follows:
      -1> add a small peice
      -2> write tests for functionality and get it bug free
      -3> run it under valgrind to check for memory leaks and get it leak free
     )
