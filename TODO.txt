# v0.0.1 
  -> fix any memory leaks present now before adding anything new to the
     language
    (and the new cycle for adding to or updating the 
      language goes as follows:
      -1> add a small peice
      -2> write tests for functionality and get it bug free
      -3> run it under valgrind to check for memory leaks and get it leak free
     )
  -> allow the programmer to specify an input file as a naked command line
      argument, and don't try to open a file named 'pink'

  -> the assembly within the main subroutine needs to tell the difference
      between being given an immediate integer as the result value, (i)
      and a load instruction from some given register, (r) so we can 
      modify the inline assembly constraints to match.
