# v0.0.1 
  -> Extend the test framework to handle running the compiler 
      against test programs. Then write a few to check for 
      more functionality

  -> add a function call Ast and get that to emit valid code 
      NOTE: this will be a c-style function call interface 
            at first, we will then refactor this to use the 
            calling convention we are going to define.
            however i do not think this will require us to 
            define a custom llvm calling convention, as 
            I think it can be accomplished on top of a c-style
            calling convention as long as functions are defined 
            to have the correct type from the perspective of 
            llvm.
