# write a tool around profiling the compiler itself, that stores the useful metrics from
profiling into a database such that we can generate graphs and other
visualizations of the profiling data. maybe even track it through time a bit.

i am really curious how big a difference it would be to change Parse, Getype, and
Codegen to take Environment references vs the std::shared_ptr<Environment> they
currently use.
