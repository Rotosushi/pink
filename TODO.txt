# fix all the bugs

# refactor the AST to use the visitor pattern for ToString, Getype, and Codegen
  # remove Clone(), i seriously don't think it will ever get used. it's always 
    cheaper to simply pass a read only reference.
  # make sure ToString emits text which can be reparsed into the identical AST.
    such that we could reconstruct the source file from the in memory representation.
    This seems more potentially useful than Clone.

# add debugger support to output programs
  # this means solving the issue that the lexer is not properly counting linenums.

# add in Debug, Release, and Profiled builds

# write a tool around profiling the compiler itself, that stores the useful metrics from
profiling into a database such that we can generate graphs and other
visualizations of the profiling data. maybe even track it through time a bit.

i am really curious how big a difference it would be to change Parse, Getype, and
Codegen to take Environment references vs the std::shared_ptr<Environment> they
currently use.
